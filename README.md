KomaMRI.jl (formerly MRIsim.jl), whose name comes from the Japanese word for spinning-top „Åì„Åæ (ko-ma) as they precess due to gravity like spins in a magnetic field. 

This package is meant to simulate general Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scenarios that could arise in pulse sequence development. 

> üü¢ **KomaMRI v0.7**: Huge code rewrite, this implies improved: performance (now **5x faster**), type stability, extensibility, and more!

## Installation
To install just write the following in the Julia REPL:

```julia
] add KomaMRI
```
## First run
KomaMRI.jl comes with a handy GUI that contains a brain phantom with an EPI sequence. To open it use:

```julia
KomaUI()
```
Press the button that says "Simulate!" to do your first simulation :). Then, a notification emerge telling you that the simulation was successful. In this notification, you can either select to (1) see the Raw signal or (2) to procced with the reconstruction.
