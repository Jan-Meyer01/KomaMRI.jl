# Simulation Examples

These examples are designed so you can go along by copying and pasting the code blocks. üòÉ. Before starting, don't forget to include the `KomaMRI` package:
```@example 1
using KomaMRI # Copy me by clicking the icon at the right! ------>

## Free Induction Decay

The free induction decay is the simplest observable NMR signal. This signal is the one that follows a single tipping RF pulse. To recreate this experiment, we will need to define a `Sequence` with 2 blocks. 

The first block containing an RF pulse with a flip-angle of 90 deg, 
```@example 1
ampRF = 2e-6                        # 2 uT RF amplitude
durRF = œÄ / 2 / (2œÄ * Œ≥ * ampRF)    # required duration for a 90 deg RF pulse
exc = RF(ampRF,durRF)
nothing # hide
```
and the second block containing the ADC.
```@example 1
nADC = 8192         # number of acquisition samples
durADC = 250e-3     # duration of the acquisition
delay =  1e-3       # small delay
acq = ADC(nADC, durADC, delay)
nothing # hide
```
Finally, we concatenate the sequence blocks to create the final sequence (for more info. refer to [Sequence Structure](useful-information.md#Sequence-Structure)).
```@example 1
seq = Sequence()  # empty sequence
seq += exc        # adding RF-only block
seq += acq        # adding ADC-only block
p = plot_seq(seq; slider=false, height=300)
savefig(p, "assets/1-seq.html") # hide
nothing # hide
```
```@raw html
<object type="text/html" data="assets/1-seq.html" style="width:100%; height:320px;"></object>
```
Now, we will define a `Phantom` with a single spin at $x=0$ with $T_1=1000\,\mathrm{ms}$ and $T_2=100\,\mathrm{ms}$.
```@example 1
obj = Phantom(x=[0], T1=[1000e-3], T2=[100e-3])
nothing # hide
```

Finally, to simulate we will need to use the function [simulate](@ref).
```@example 1
sys = Scanner() # default hardware definition
raw = simulate(obj, seq, sys)
``` 
To plot the results we will need to use the [plot_signal](@ref) function 

```@example 1
p = plot_signal(raw; slider=false, height=300)
savefig(p, "assets/1-signal.html"); nothing # hide
```
```@raw html
<object type="text/html" data="assets/1-signal.html" style="width:100%; height:320px;"></object>
```
Nice!, we can see that $S(t)$ follows an exponential decay $\exp(-t/T_2)$ as expected.

For a little bit of spiciness, let's add **off-resonance** to our example. We will use $\Delta f=-100\,\mathrm{Hz}$. For this, we will need to add a definition for `Œîw` in our `Phantom`
```@example 1
obj = Phantom(x=[0], T1=[1000e-3], T2=[100e-3], Œîw=[-2œÄ*100])
nothing # hide
```
and simulate again.
```@setup 1
raw = simulate(obj, seq, sys)
p = plot_signal(raw; slider=false, height=300)
savefig(p, "assets/2-signal.html"); nothing # hide
```
```@raw html
<object type="text/html" data="assets/2-signal.html" style="width:100%; height:320px;"></object>
```
The signal now follows an exponential of the form $\exp(-t/T_2)\cdot\exp(-i\Delta\omega t)$. The addition of $\exp(-i\Delta\omega t)$ to the signal will generate a shift in the image space (Fourier shifting property). This effect will be better visualized and explained in later examples.

# Chemical Shift in an EPI sequence

For a more realistic example, we will use a brain phantom. 

```@setup 2
using KomaMRI
sys = Scanner()
```
```@example 2
obj = brain_phantom2D() # a slice of a brain
p1 = plot_phantom_map(obj, :T2 ; height=400)
p2 = plot_phantom_map(obj, :Œîw ; height=400)
savefig(p1, "assets/1-phantom.html"); nothing # hide
savefig(p2, "assets/2-phantom.html"); nothing # hide
```
At the left, you can see the $T_2$ map of the phantom, and at the right, the off-resonance $\Delta\omega$. In this example, the fat is the only source of off-resonance (with $\Delta f =  -220\,\mathrm{Hz}$) and you can see it in black in the off-resonance map.
```@raw html
<object type="text/html" data="assets/1-phantom.html" style="width:50%; height:420px;"></object><object type="text/html" data="assets/2-phantom.html" style="width:50%; height:420px;"></object>
```
Then, we will load an EPI sequence, that is well known for being affected by off-resonance. With this sequence, we will be able visualize the effect of the chemical shift.

```@setup 2
seq = read_seq("../../examples/3.koma_paper/comparison/sequences/EPI/epi_100x100_TE100_FOV230.seq")
p = plot_seq(seq; range=[90. 120.], slider=true, height=300)
savefig(p, "assets/2-seq.html"); 
```
```julia
seq = read_seq("examples/3.koma_paper/comparison/sequences/EPI/epi_100x100_TE100_FOV230.seq")
```
Feel free to explore the sequence plot üîç below!
```@raw html
<object type="text/html" data="assets/2-seq.html" style="width:100%; height:320px;"></object>
```
If we simulate this sequence we will end up with the following signal.
```@example 2
raw = simulate(obj, seq, sys)
```
```@setup 2
p = plot_signal(raw; range=[120.4 122.2] , height=300)
savefig(p, "assets/3-signal.html"); nothing # hide
```
```@raw html
<object type="text/html" data="assets/3-signal.html" style="width:100%; height:320px;"></object>
```
Now, we need to inspect what effect the off-resonance had in the reconstructed image. As you can see, the fat layer is now shifted to a different position ü§Ø, this is why the effect is called chemical shift!
```@example 2
# Get the acquisition data
acq = AcquisitionData(raw)
acq.traj[1].circular = false #This is to remove a circular mask

# Setting up the reconstruction parameters
Nx, Ny = raw.params["reconSize"][1:2]
reconParams = Dict{Symbol,Any}(:reco=>"direct", :reconSize=>(Nx, Ny))
image = reconstruction(acq, reconParams)

# Plotting the recon
slice_abs = abs.(image[:, :, 1])
p = plot_image(slice_abs; height=400)
savefig(p, "assets/1-recon.html");  nothing # hide
```
